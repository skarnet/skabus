<h1> The <tt>skabus</tt> library interface </h1>

<h2> General information </h2>

<p>
 <tt>libskabus</tt> is a collection of C client libraries used
to communicate with the various skabus daemons.
</p>

<h2> Compiling </h2>

<ul>
 <li> Make sure the skabus headers, as well as the skalibs headers,
are visible in your header search path. </li>
 <li> Use <tt>#include &lt;skabus/skabus.h&gt;</tt> </li>
</ul>

<h2> Linking </h2>

<ul>
 <li> Make sure the skabus libraries, as well as the skalibs
libraries, are visible in your library search path. </li>
 <li> Link against <tt>-lskabus</tt> and <tt>-lskarnet</tt>.
If you're using socket functions (which is the case with
<a href="rpc.html">skabus_rpc</a>, for instance, add
<tt>`cat $sysdeps/socket.lib`</tt> to your command line.
If you're using timed functions involving TAI timestamps
(which is also the case with <a href="rpc.html">skabus_rpc</a>
for instance), add
<tt>`cat $sysdeps/sysclock.lib`</tt>. <tt>$sysdeps</tt>
stands for your skalibs sysdeps directory. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Programming </h2>

<h3> Preamble: synchronous functions </h3>

<p>
 The bulk of <tt>libskabus</tt> functions takes two extra arguments at the
end: <em>deadline</em> and <em>stamp</em>. Their type is
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/skalibs/libstddjb/tai.html">tain_t</a>. This means
they are synchronous function calls, and the extra arguments are there to ensure
those calls do not block forever.
</p>

<p>
<em>stamp</em> must be first initialized to an
accurate enough approximation of the current time, for instance via skalibs'
<tt>tain_now()</tt> function; it will then be automatically updated by the
skabus function calls to always contain (an accurate enough approximation
of) the current time.
</p>

<p>
<em>deadline</em> is an absolute date. The meaning is: if the function has
not returned by <em>deadline</em>, its operation is interrupted, and it
will immediately return with a failure code, and <tt>errno</tt>
will be set to <tt>ETIMEDOUT</tt>.
</p>

<p>
<em>deadline</em> and <em>stamp</em> are used internally to compute a
timeout, because blocking functions such as
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/functions/poll.html">poll()</a>
use timeouts. The functions (like most skarnet.org functions) prefer to
take a deadline and a timestamp instead of a timeout, because it's much
easier (for both the application and the library's implementation) to
work with absolute deadlines and update a timestamp regularly than it is
to recompute a bunch of timeouts after every operation that potentially
takes time.
</p>

<p>
 <a href="//skarnet.org/software/skalibs/">skalibs</a> can keep track of the
timestamp for you, in the global <tt>STAMP</tt> variable. All <tt>libskabus</tt>
functions taking a <em>deadline</em> and <em>stamp</em> argument also have a
version with a name ending in <tt>_g</tt>, that does not take <em>stamp</em>, and
assumes the <tt>STAMP</tt> variable always contains (an accurate
enough approximation of) the current time.
</p>

<p>
 Those synchronous function calls normally return almost instantly: there should
be no blocking code path between the function call and its return. Nevertheless,
since they involve communication with another process, they are at the whim
of the scheduler, so it's impossible to guarantee that they will never block.
The use of the <em>deadline</em> and <em>stamp</em> arguments
ensures there is a cap on the amount of time they block.
</p>

<h3> skabus functions </h3>

<p>
 The <tt>skabus/skabus.h</tt> header is actually a
concatenation of other headers:
the libskabus is separated into several modules, each of them with its
own header.
</p>

<ul>
 <li> The <a href="rpc.html">skabus/rpc.h</a> header provides
functions to communicate with a
<a href="../skabus-rpcd.html">skabus-rpcd</a> server, and help
clients serve RPC calls or perform RPC calls to other registered
clients. </li>
</ul>
